**Expense Tracker Collab Project**  
Due date: February 18th, 11:59pm

Work in teams of 2-3 students to create a Python program that manages and tracks expenses. Each team will build an expense tracking system using **dictionaries** to store expense data such as **categories**, **amounts**, and **dates**. The goal is to use python dictionaries to organize and manage data and collaborate on Github.

**The expense tracker will allow users to:**

* Add new expense  
* View all expenses  
* Filter expenses by category  
* Calculate the total expenses  
* Delete specific expenses

**Team Roles:**

* One person handles adding expenses.  
* Another implements the calculation of total expenses.  
* Another works on filtering or deleting expenses.  
* **Work on GitHub by cloning the repository, creating branches, and submitting pull requests.**

**Extension (optional 4 marks):**

* **Create a feature to generate expense summaries by week, month, or year.**  
* Integrate data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib to display spending trends.

Marking Scheme:

**Basic Features (20 marks)**

* Adding Expenses (4 marks): The program should allow users to input expense details like category, amount, and date.  
* Viewing Expenses (5 marks): All expenses should be displayed in **a clear and organized format.**  
* Calculating Total Expenses (4 marks): The program should correctly sum up and display the total of all expenses.  
* Deleting Expenses (5 marks): Users should be able to remove specific expenses by category and date.  
* Proper use of comments (4 marks): Functions and complex logic are documented clearly.  
* Code organization (5 marks): Functions are modular, and variables have meaningful names.  
* Error Handling (5 marks): Ensures the program doesn’t crash due to common errors (e.g., invalid inputs, empty dictionaries).  
* **Repository setup and organization (5 marks): Includes a clear README file with instructions and responsibilities/credits of each member** 

**Reflection (8 marks)**

* A short write-up in the README file:  
  * The roles/tasks that each member has in the project  
  * The functionalities of the Expense Tracker (the features)  
  * The challenges of the project and how to overcome the problems; tell me whether your group enjoys collaborative coding or not, why or why not? Explain
